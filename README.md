Header Heaven
==============

A tool for generating C++ methods given C++ headers. Header Heaven uses it's own **simple** C++ header parser, so expect it to break every now and then. (If you mess around with stuff like volatile, mutable etc. it probably won't handle it too well)

How to build
--------------

To build HeaderHeaven you need to grab **premake5** executable from [here](https://premake.github.io/download.html), and drop it in build/ folder.
Then simply double-click vs2013.bat, which will generate visual studio project files. If you're not on windows, you'll have to figure out how to invoke
premake yourself (sorry!) - use vs2013.bat as a reference.

How to use
--------------

Once you build HeaderHeaven, create a config.txt file next to the executable. Then edit it to match this format:

	headersPath sourcesPath
	headersPath sourcesPath
	...

The paths are relative, so for example:

	MyProject/include/ MyProject/src/

Would be a correct configuration, as long as MyProject folder is right next to HeaderHeaven executable.
